Ether
- Ether     : A transferable unit of value
- Gas       : The cost of an opcode 
- GasPrice  : How many ethers per unit of gas

Note:
Opcode Costs
math, conditionals, jumps 0-10
creating contract 32000
blockchain variable storage 20000
transaction 21000
maximum block gas limit 6.7m

~ US$0.532 / 21000 gas

- All Miners are nodes, not all nodes are Miners
- Miners have a say in eventual consistency of the blockchain
